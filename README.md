# Remove-anti-adblock-YouTube

YouTube released an update where they will automatically open a warning pop-up if you are using an adblocker. 
This snipper closes the anti-adblock popup and resume the video.
It saves you the hassle of clicking and it works every time.

We don't want to pay a Premium subscription because even if we do we will still see sponsored contents inside the videos.
We value our time and YT doesn't compensate the content creators sufficiently for their work and contribution.
We want to support our favorite creators and also the industry but in a fair way. 
Thank you.
